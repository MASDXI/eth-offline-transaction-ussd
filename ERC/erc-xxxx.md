## Motivation
In scenarios with limited or unreliable internet access, traditional digital payment methods may not be feasible. Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) provides a vital solution by enabling offline transactions like payments, transfers, and balance inquiries without requiring internet connectivity. Its simplicity and broad compatibility with basic mobile devices and Electronic Draft Capture (EDC) device make USSD an essential tool for mobile payments, particularly in underserved areas, supporting financial inclusion and broader access to digital financial services.

Use cases for offline payments including
- Credit
- e-Money
- Insurance
- Loyalty program
- Retail Central Bank Digital Currency (rCBDC)

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Custodian Wallet

With custodian wallet, allowing token movement even when the user lacks direct synchronization with the blockchain network.

### Schema

- sendTransaction

``` json
"payload": {
    "network": "<STRING>",
    "sub_id": "<HEX_VALUE>",
    "recipient": "<STRING>",
    "value": "<HEX_VALUE>",
    "currency": "<STRING>",
    "pin": "<STRING>",
}
```

``` json
"response": {
    "balance": "<HEX_VALUE>",
    "currency": "<STRING>",
    "transaction_hash": "<HEX_STRING>",
}
```

When transferring native tokens, the `currency` key **MUST** be `0` or `null`.  
The callback **MUST** return the latest `balance` of the specified `currency` and a `transactionHash`
The `currency` **SHOULD** be represented by the token's `symbol`, which is mapped to a `number`, allowing the user to select the token they wish to send.
If the transaction is successful, these details are returned to the `sender`; otherwise, a `error` message is provided.

- getBalance
  
``` json
"payload": {
    "network": "<STRING>",
    "sub_id": "<HEX_VALUE>",
    "currency": "<STRING>",
}
```

``` json
"response": {
    "balance": "<HEX_VALUE>",
    "currency": "<STRING>",
}
```

When get balance of native tokens, the `currency` key **MUST** be `0` or `null`.
The callback **MUST** return the latest `balance` of the specified `currency`.

> **MUST** support to pay with `address` **OPTIONAL** `ens`,`phone number`, `email`, `username` or `unique Id`  
not covering transaction to smart contract with USSD cause application **MAY** update the data frequently.  

- getTransactionByHash
  
``` json
"payload": {
    "network": "<STRING>",
    "sub_id": "<HEX_VALUE>",
    "transaction_hash": "<HEX_VALUE>"
}
```

``` json
"response": {
    // transaction information see eth_getTransactionByHash and eth_getTransactionReceipt
}
```
